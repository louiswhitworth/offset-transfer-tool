I am an aspiring technical animator/rigging artist and I am currently looking for entry-level work. If you're interested in hiring me, please shoot me an email at whitworthlouis@gmail.com and I'd be happy to share my resume with you.

Maya tool that allows the user to instantly transfer transform values to/from offset parent matrix 

Modern rigging workflows benefit from the ease and clarity that storing transforms in the offset parent matrix provides. However, Maya doesn't provide any quick means of sending transform values to/from the OPM, and the time it takes to manually transfer values on even simple rigs can quickly add up. This tool speeds up the process by allowing the user to instantly transfer transform values without needing to interrupt their workflow. 

See a demo of the tool on my Artstation: https://www.artstation.com/whitworthlouis
